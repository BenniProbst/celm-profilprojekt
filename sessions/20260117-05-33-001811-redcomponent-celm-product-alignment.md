# Session: redcomponent-celm product clone alignment

Date: 2026-01-17 05:33
Scope: Align Products/redcomponent-celm after restoring module sources in the shared repo.

## Updates
- Rebased the product clone to the restored module source tree so Modules remain canonical and Products stay in sync.
- Confirmed CMakeLists.txt retains the duplicate target guard to avoid double definitions when both scopes are present.

## Files
- CMakeLists.txt
